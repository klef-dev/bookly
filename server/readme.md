# Bookly API

## Getting Started

### Using Yarn

- First of all clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/klefcodes/bookly.git`

- Then you have to `cd bookly/server`

- Run `cp .env.example .env` and make any changes necessary in that file

- If you don't have yarn installed click the following link https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install.

- Run the 👇🏼 command
  ```sh
  $ yarn install
  ```
  This will install the dependencies meant for the api to run smoothly.
- Lastly you need to run 👇🏼

  ```sh
  $ yarn dev
  ```

  This serves the api by default on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333/api/v1).

  Happy coding 👨🏼‍💻
